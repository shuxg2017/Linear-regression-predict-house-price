# Multi Linear Regression for House Price Prediction
### Overview Result
We used house price dataset to train a multi linear regression model. <br>
In our final result, r_square = 0.725, and accuracy = 80%. <br>
In other words, our model can capture 72.5% of the variability from the actual house price. <br>
our model can capture 80% of the actual house price. <br>

### Process
